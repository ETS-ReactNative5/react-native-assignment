# react-native-assignment
=====

simple goal app, written in react just to get a feeling for the language
and libraries. This app allowed me to finish an assignment

* react (http://facebook.github.io/react/)


design
=====
This simple demo app uses react on the client utilizing the flux (http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) pattern to ensure one way communication. 


Again, this app really isn't meant to do much other than let me do an assignment
requirements
